# Vector Database Architecture

## Executive Summary

The Vector Database API provides a scalable solution for indexing and querying document embeddings. The system implements multiple indexing algorithms from scratch, ensures thread-safe operations, and follows Domain-Driven Design principles. The architecture prioritizes modularity, performance, and maintainability while adhering to SOLID principles throughout the codebase.

## System Overview

### High-Level Architecture

The system employs a layered architecture pattern that separates concerns across multiple tiers:

```

### Core Components

The system consists of four main components that interact to provide the complete functionality:

1. **API Layer**: Handles HTTP requests, validates input, and returns responses
2. **Service Layer**: Implements business logic and coordinates between components
3. **Repository Layer**: Abstracts data access and provides a clean interface
4. **Infrastructure Layer**: Manages low-level operations including indexing and storage

## Domain Model

### Entity Design

The domain model consists of three primary entities that form the core of the system:

#### Library Entity
The Library entity represents a collection of documents with associated metadata and indexing configuration. Each library maintains its own vector index and can be configured with different indexing algorithms based on use case requirements.

Key attributes include:
- Unique identifier (UUID)
- Name and description
- Index type configuration (LSH, HNSW, or KD-Tree)
- Vector dimension specification
- Custom metadata fields
- Timestamp tracking for audit purposes

#### Document Entity
The Document entity serves as a logical grouping of related chunks within a library. Documents maintain relationships with their parent library and child chunks, facilitating hierarchical organization of content.

Key attributes include:
- Unique identifier (UUID)
- Reference to parent library
- Collection of associated chunks
- Document-level metadata
- Creation and modification timestamps

#### Chunk Entity
The Chunk entity represents the atomic unit of searchable content. Each chunk contains textual content, its vector embedding, and associated metadata. Chunks are immutable once created to ensure consistency in the vector index.

Key attributes include:
- Unique identifier (UUID)
- Text content
- Vector embedding (fixed-dimension float array)
- Reference to parent document
- Position within document
- Custom metadata fields

### Value Objects

The system employs several value objects to encapsulate domain concepts:

#### SearchQuery
Encapsulates all parameters required for vector similarity search:
- Query embedding vector
- Number of results (k)
- Metadata filters
- Target library identifier

#### SearchResult
Represents a single search result with similarity metrics:
- Matched chunk
- Distance score
- Relevance ranking
- Metadata highlights

#### IndexConfiguration
Defines parameters for vector index creation:
- Algorithm selection
- Algorithm-specific parameters
- Performance tuning options

## Indexing Algorithms

The system implements three distinct indexing algorithms, each optimized for different use cases and performance characteristics.

### Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)

LSH provides approximate nearest neighbor search with sub-linear query time. The implementation uses random hyperplane projection to create hash signatures for vectors.

**Algorithm Details:**
- The system generates multiple hash tables with different random projections
- Each vector gets hashed into buckets based on binary signatures
- Query vectors check only buckets with matching signatures
- Final candidates undergo exact distance calculation

**Performance Characteristics:**
- Search complexity: O(L × K) where L = number of tables, K = average bucket size
- Space complexity: O(n × L) where n = number of vectors
- Optimal for large datasets requiring fast approximate results

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Number of hash tables balances recall vs. performance
- Hash signature length affects collision probability
- Bucket size impacts query speed and accuracy

### Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW)

HNSW creates a multi-layer graph structure that enables logarithmic search complexity. The algorithm builds connections between similar vectors at multiple scales.

**Algorithm Details:**
- Constructs hierarchical layers with exponentially decreasing node density
- Each node connects to M nearest neighbors within its layer
- Search navigates from top layer to bottom using greedy traversal
- Maintains both long-range and short-range connections

**Performance Characteristics:**
- Search complexity: O(log n) average case
- Space complexity: O(n × M) where M = maximum connections per node
- Excellent recall with tunable speed/accuracy tradeoff

**Implementation Considerations:**
- M parameter controls graph connectivity and memory usage
- ef_construction affects index build quality
- Layer assignment uses exponential decay probability

### KD-Tree with Random Projections

The implementation adapts traditional KD-Trees for high-dimensional vectors using random projection techniques to mitigate the curse of dimensionality.

**Algorithm Details:**
- Projects vectors to lower-dimensional subspace before partitioning
- Recursively divides space using median splits
- Maintains balanced tree structure
- Implements backtracking for k-nearest neighbor guarantee

**Performance Characteristics:**
- Search complexity: O(log n) best case, O(n) worst case
- Space complexity: O(n)
- Performs well for moderate dimensions with clustered data

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Random projection preserves distance relationships probabilistically
- Tree rebalancing maintains search efficiency
- Leaf size parameter affects tree depth vs. linear search tradeoff

## Concurrency Design

### Thread Safety Strategy

The system implements a sophisticated concurrency model to handle simultaneous read and write operations without data races.

#### Read-Write Lock Pattern
The implementation uses reader-writer locks with the following characteristics:
- Multiple concurrent readers allowed
- Writers obtain exclusive access
- Lock upgrading prevented to avoid deadlocks
- Fair scheduling prevents starvation

#### Copy-on-Write Semantics
Write operations follow copy-on-write principles:
1. Acquire write lock
2. Create deep copy of affected data structure
3. Perform modifications on copy
4. Atomically swap references
5. Release lock

This approach minimizes lock hold time and ensures readers always see consistent state.

#### Lock Hierarchy
The system enforces a strict lock ordering to prevent deadlocks:
1. Library-level locks
2. Document-level locks
3. Chunk-level locks
4. Index-level locks

Locks must be acquired in this order and released in reverse order.

### Asynchronous Operations

Long-running operations execute asynchronously to maintain API responsiveness:

#### Index Building
- Queued for background processing
- Progress tracking via job identifiers
- Non-blocking API responses
- Eventual consistency model

#### Bulk Operations
- Batched for efficiency
- Streaming processing for large datasets
- Progress notifications available
- Transactional semantics where applicable

## API Design

#### Error Response Format
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "Library with id '123' not found",
    "details": {
      "resource_type": "library",
      "resource_id": "123"
